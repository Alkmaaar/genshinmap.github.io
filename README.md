## Credits

This map is not my creation; it was originally developed and filled out by the Chinese community, at http://www.yuanshen.site/.
/u/gbdematos downloaded the map and translated parts of it into English, and I uploaded it for public viewing on GitHub.

That said, I am open to pull requests to expand this map or add/remove features to it. If you have any concerns, [message me](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=EliteMasterEric).

I looked through the code, and it appears there are several obstacles to further development of this map:

- [ ] ALL of the location data appears to be [on one line of JavaScript](https://github.com/GenshinMap/genshinmap.github.io/blob/master/js/Item_Json.js#L205). It should ideally be moved out.
- [ ] Large parts of the code, such as those referring to categories, appear to be untranslated (for example, Anemoculus are on the layer Layer_FST). It would be useful for future development for these to be translated.
