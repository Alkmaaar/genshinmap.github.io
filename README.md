# GenshinMap.github.io

GenshinMap is a free open-source interactive map for [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/), powered by React, [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html), and community contributions.

The map includes a full, high-resolution in-game map, with options to display markers for the locations

This project is open source. [Issues](https://github.com/GenshinMap/genshinmap.github.io/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/GenshinMap/genshinmap.github.io/pulls) are welcome and highly appreciated.

## Credits

This map was originally a translated mirror of [a Chinese language map](http://www.yuanshen.site/), but later the source code was completely rewritten to facilitate expansion and feature enhancements.

## To-Do

- [ ] Make it easy to make pull requests to add new markers (I noticed some were missing, for example several Electro Crystal nodes)
- [ ] Make it easy to clear To-Do status of all markers of a certain subcategory (For example, you could mark all the Elite Enemies or White Iron then reset them for the next day)
