# tiles

This folder contains images of the world map at various zoom levels.

The images are of the format `tiles/{z}/ppp{x}_{y}`, where z is the zoom level from 3 to 8, and x and y are the coordinates, with (0,0) being in the top left.

To generate a new world map, you would need to generate a large image of the game's world map and split it up accurately.
